## Amanda Nelson Portfolio Site - UMN Full Stack Bootcamp Challenge 2 ##

** User Story ** 

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

** Acceptance Criteria **

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them ✔️
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section ✔️
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications ✔️
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others ❌
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application ✔️
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport ✔️/ ❌

** Notes for the developer **

1. Experiment more with the hero image & get that to work correctly.
2. Gained a lot of confidence with using IDs and classes to target HTML elements.
3. Need more practice with wireframing and overall site planning. 
4. Experiment with @media property to better create a responsive layout.

** Notes for Users **

This is a portfolio website in development. Many images and elements are placeholders although site functionality should work as expected. Questions or concerns can be directed to amanda92nelson@gmail.com.
